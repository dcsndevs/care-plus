|-|-|
| Warning error: /Users/dcsn/care-plus/run.py:385: DeprecationWarning: Worksheet.delete_row() is deprecated, Please use `Worksheet.delete_rows()` instead|I replaced code with worksheet.delete_row(row) instead |


### Browser Testing: 
The final project was tested on four different browsers, namely:
-Microsoft Internet Explorer
-Google Chrome
-Brave
-Mozilla Firefox
However, the application did not work on Mobile devices and the display was unresponsive.



### CI Python Linter:
The CI Python Linter https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/ was used to test for errors in the code. No errors were found except for warning concerning white spaces or characters being longer than the 79 characters that was originally deisgned for the application

## Lucid:
Lucid was used to draw mock-ups for the initial app design to guide the development of this project.

![Lucid Sketch](documentation/flow-chart-simple.png)

## Technologies used:
- Python is the main technolgy used in this application
- Luci was used to create workflows for guidance in builfing the application
- VScode was used to write and edit the codes and host the site on my local computer
- Git was used for the version control of the application
- Heroku was used to host the deployed application
- ChatGPT was often consulted regarding the usage and construction of codes
- Google Chrome's "Screenshot & Screen Recorder" plugin was used to create the site logo
- Code Institute Python Linter was used to check code for any issues

## Deployment

The template for this app was generated from Code-Institute-Org/p3-template. The repository was cloned on a local VSCode machine and then stored/managed on Github. 

The Heroku gi URl is https://git.heroku.com/care-plus.git


The app was then deployed on Heroku via Github:

1. Log in to Heroku or create a new account
2. On the main page click "New" and select "Create new app"
3. Choose your unique app name and select your region
4. Click "Create app"
5. On the next page find "settings" and locate "Config Vars"
6. Click "Reveal Config Vars" and add "PORT" key and value "8000", click "Add"
7. Scroll down, locate "Buildpack" and click "Add", select "Python"
8. Repeat step 7. only this time add "Node.js", make sure "Python" is first
9. Scroll to the top and select "Deploy" tab
10. Select GitHub as deployment method and search for your repository and link them together
11. Scroll down and select either "Enable Automatic Deploys" or "Manual Deploy"
Deployed site -> [Here](https://care-plus-e6b7c675e391.herokuapp.com/)



### Local Deployment:
To clone this project, you can do so using VsCode or any code editor that has an integrated development Environment (IDE), using this command: 

     git clone https://github.com/dcsndevs/care-plus.git 


## Dependencies

- [gspread](https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [oauth2client](https://oauth2client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Usage

Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the application. Input valid data as guided by the application.

## Future Development and Limitations
More functionalities would be handy in this application. Extra functionality to include, manually determining the period of time time that a student's overall progress should be populated. It would also go further to include exporting this information to a local machine or sending it to a user provided email address.


## Credits

### Code Reference:
W3schools was instrumental to the success of this project. It was often used to learn quick features or to compare and see where errors are.

### CarePlus Logic: 
The logic behid the application is a real life application called [Â©WellTree] (https://www.welltree.info/)
Welltree inputs are manually done on an excel worksheet, but this application was built with the intention of automating the inputs and view student progress over time.
