## Bugs:
| Issue|Solution |
|-|-|
| The timer could be paused by clicking 'Quit' button.|I introduced a 'div' that displayed above the question, allowing the user to confirm their choice while the questions remain hidden |
| The timer kept running even when a session had ended|I used the 'clearInterval' function to stop the timer |
| The choice selection for an answer, retained the red color when the user goes to the next question|I set 'const' color for the options|
| In Mozilla browser, the quit button was immediately taking users to result page, without alerting them to confirm their choice|I removed the alert function and instead added a confirmation button on the 'hide-screen' div |
|Print button on result page not working for Bing mobile browser| None yet|

### Browser Testing: 
The final project was tested on four different browsers, namely:
-Microsoft Internet Explorer
-Google Chrome
-Brave
-Mozilla Firefox
However, the application did not work on Mobile devices and the display was unresponsive.



### CI Python Linter:
The CI Python Linter https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/ was used to test for errors in the code. No errors were found except for warning concerning white spaces or characters being longer than the 79 characters that was originally deisgned for the application

- Git was used for the version control of the application
- Heroku was used to host the deployed application
- ChatGPT was often consulted regarding the usage and construction of codes
- Google Chrome's "Screenshot & Screen Recorder" plugin was used to create the site logo
- Code Institute Python Linter was used to check code for any issues

## Deployment

The template for this app was generated from Code-Institute-Org/p3-template. The repository was cloned on a local VSCode machine and then stored/managed on Github. 

The Heroku gi URl is https://git.heroku.com/care-plus.git


The app was then deployed on Heroku via Github:

1. Log in to Heroku or create a new account
2. On the main page click "New" and select "Create new app"
3. Choose your unique app name and select your region
4. Click "Create app"
5. On the next page find "settings" and locate "Config Vars"
6. Click "Reveal Config Vars" and add "PORT" key and value "8000", click "Add"
7. Scroll down, locate "Buildpack" and click "Add", select "Python"
8. Repeat step 7. only this time add "Node.js", make sure "Python" is first
9. Scroll to the top and select "Deploy" tab
10. Select GitHub as deployment method and search for your repository and link them together
11. Scroll down and select either "Enable Automatic Deploys" or "Manual Deploy"

## Credits

### Code Reference:
W3schools was instrumental to the success of this project. It was often used to learn quick features or to compare and see where errors are.

### CarePlus Logic: 
The logic behid the application is a real life application called [Â©WellTree] (https://www.welltree.info/)
Welltree inputs are manually done on an excel worksheet, but this application was built with the intention of automating the inputs and view student progress over time.
